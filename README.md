# Neural-Style-Transfer-PyTorch
A PyTorch implementation of "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" paper by Gatys et. al

Project based on original paper, Pytorch's Neural Style Transfer tutorial and Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization 
CNN course section about Neural Style Transfer.

## And a cat in style of pikachu... I guess? (300x300)
### I guess that one was a bad idea, but hey, money on power bills was already spent, so here it is.
